CSS like all programming languages is sublte and tedious, but not in a right or wrong way, more in a what you want and what you get way. See when you get CSS wrong you dont get a error (if its synax you do) instead you get a wonky looking UI. To me this is why CSS is the most frusterating language I know so far. I dont get an explanation for why the icon bar is covering up the main header instead I have to find the reason my self. But what CSS allows is more tangible than all the other languages. Humans are visual animals, so when I see the fruits of my labor before my eyes its instantly rewarding.
