I started to learn about the wonders of programming while still in high school. I didnt start because of the good pay, instead it was because of an idea. Every one has ideas for the next big thing some more than others, but somtimes you get an idea that sticks. An idea that takes over all thoughts, a what-if idea that must be done. I had one of those in my sophmore year of high school, and its been in my head ever since. But before doing this idea I needed to at least know the fundemntals of programming.
