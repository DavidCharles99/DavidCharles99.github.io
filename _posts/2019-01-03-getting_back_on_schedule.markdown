I've been neglecting to stay on track last year due to my first ever programming job. Now that it is the new year I have decided to finish what I started. I want to focus on strengthening my programming knowledge in order to open up more opportunities in my career. Starting today I will do school full time and finish this course. In order to do this somthing in my life has to change. First thing is shorting my hours, now instead of 35 hours a week I will work 10. Next I want to get into a rhythm, so my goal is to start school at 9 am and end at 3 as this wont interfere with my work schedule. 

Writing this down is extreaming helpful as it will hold my accountable to my actions and instentivise me to work hard.
